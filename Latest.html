              <hr class="my-4">
              <p>According to the CDC, the virus is thought to be spread mainly from person-to-person. This means it may spread between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), or through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br> These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. 
                The CDC also reports that it may be possible for someone to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object with the virus on it, and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.<br>
                The best way to prevent illness from COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to the virus, as there is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19.</p>

            <h5>Have You Recovered from COVID-19?</h5>
            <p>People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their plasma that may help attack the virus.  The Red Cross is helping to identify prospective donors and manage the distribution of donated convalescent plasma to hospitals treating patients in need. 
              If you're fully recovered from a verified coronavirus (COVID-19) diagnosis, please visit RedCrossBlood.org/plasma4covid to help current patients who are seriously ill.</p>

              <h1 class="display-4">What to Know about COVID-19 and Blood Donation</h1>
              <hr class="my-4">
              <p>The American Red Cross has an urgent need for blood and platelet donations to prevent another blood shortage as hospitals resume all surgical procedures and patient treatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent weeks, hospital demand for blood products has significantly increased by 30% since demand sharply declined in early April amid this rapidly changing and complex environment. 
                At the same time, blood drives continue to be canceled as many businesses and community organizations remain closed.<br>
                Each Red Cross blood drive and donation center follows the highest standards of safety and infection control.<br>
                There is no known end date in this fight against coronavirus, and the <strong>Red Cross urgently needs the help of donors</strong> and blood drive hosts to ensure blood products are readily available for patients. If you are feeling well, please make an appointment to give by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS.</p>
